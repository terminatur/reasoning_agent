# Product Context: AI Research Agent

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Research is time-consuming, fragmented, and often lacks proper citation management. Current tools either:
- Provide surface-level information without depth
- Require extensive manual effort to synthesize multiple sources
- Lack transparency in methodology and source verification
- Don't maintain context across research sessions

### Solution Vision
An autonomous AI research agent that can think, plan, and execute comprehensive research like a human researcher, but with:
- Systematic methodology and consistent quality
- Transparent reasoning and citation tracking
- Ability to handle complex, multi-step research workflows
- Persistent memory for building on previous research

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Query Input**: User provides a research question or topic
2. **Planning Phase**: Agent analyzes the query and creates a structured research plan
3. **Execution Phase**: Agent systematically executes research steps using available tools
4. **Synthesis Phase**: Agent compiles findings into a comprehensive report
5. **Delivery**: User receives a well-structured report with verifiable citations

### Core Interactions
- **Simple Queries**: Single research question â†’ Comprehensive report
- **Interactive Mode**: Ongoing conversation with status updates and refinement
- **Resume Capability**: Pick up where previous research left off
- **Export Options**: Multiple formats for different use cases
